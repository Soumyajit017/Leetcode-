Got it man ðŸ‘Š â€” letâ€™s make a **README.md** thatâ€™s both professional (for GitHub) *and* brutally honest about the mistakes you tripped on (so itâ€™s useful for you later).
Iâ€™ll write it as if youâ€™re documenting your own learning curve.

## Problem: Remove Outermost Parentheses

You are given a valid parentheses string `s`.

A valid parentheses string is **primitive** if it cannot be split into two smaller valid ones.
We want to remove the **outermost parentheses** from every primitive part of `s`.

**Examples**

```
Input:  "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"

Input:  "(()())(())(()(()))"
Output: "()()()()(())"

Input:  "()()"
Output: ""
```

Constraints:

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s[i]` is either `'('` or `')'`
* `s` is guaranteed valid

---

## Intuition & Theory (Things to Remember)

1. **Valid parentheses string** = balanced brackets like `"()"`, `"(())"`, `"()()"`.
2. **Primitive** = the smallest indivisible valid block, e.g. `"()"`, `"(())"`, `"(()())"`.

   * `"()()"` is not primitive, itâ€™s two primitives stuck together.
3. **Decomposition** = break the string into primitive parts.

   * Example: `"(()())(())"` â†’ `"(()())" + "(())"`.
4. **Task** = remove the **first `'('` and the last `')'`** from each primitive.

---

## Approaches

### 1. Brute Force (Replace)

* Keep removing `"()"`, `"[]"`, `"{}"` from the string until nothing is left.
* If string becomes empty â†’ valid.
* Too slow for big input (`O(n^2)`), but easy to think about.

---

### 2. Counter-based Stack Simulation (Optimal for `()`)

* Use a `counter` to track how many open parentheses weâ€™re inside.
* For each character:

  * If `'('`:

    * Append it only if `counter > 0` (so skip outermost).
    * Then increment counter.
  * If `')'`:

    * Decrement counter first (weâ€™re closing).
    * Append it only if `counter > 0` (so skip outermost).
* Build result in one pass (`O(n)`).

---

## The Final Code

```python
class Solution:
    def removeOuterParentheses(self, s: str) -> str:
        result = []
        counter = 0

        for char in s:
            if char == '(':
                if counter > 0:          # skip outermost '('
                    result.append(char)
                counter += 1
            else:  # char == ')'
                counter -= 1
                if counter > 0:          # skip outermost ')'
                    result.append(char)

        return "".join(result)
```

## Where I Sucked (Mistakes I Made ðŸ¤¦)

This is the most important section â€” I want to **remember my mistakes** so I never repeat them.

1. **Indentation Hell**

   * I kept getting `IndentationError`.
   * Python doesnâ€™t forgive sloppy spacing â€” make sure every line inside a function is aligned properly.

2. **Using `append[char]` instead of `append(char)`**

   * `append` is a function, not a list indexer.
   * Correct: `result.append(char)`.

3. **Wrong order of counter updates**

   * At first I did:

     ```python
     if char == '(':
         counter += 1
         if counter > 0:
             result.append(char)
     ```

     This accidentally included outermost `'('`.
   * Fix: **check before incrementing for `'('`**, and **decrement before check for `')'`**.
   * Order matters!

4. **Else block bug**

   * I once wrote:

     ```python
     if counter > 0:
         result.append(char)
         counter -= 1
     ```

     Wrong, because I was checking before decrement. Outer `')'` sneaked into result.

5. **Trying to handle `{}` and `[]` with just a counter**

   * A counter works only for `()` because order doesnâ€™t matter.
   * For multiple bracket types (`()[]{}`) â†’ need a **stack** to track which kind youâ€™re closing.

---

## Complexity

* **Time:** O(n) (one pass).
* **Space:** O(n) (result string).

---

## Key Takeaways

* For only `()` â†’ counter method is cleanest.
* Order of increment/decrement vs check is CRUCIAL.
* For multiple bracket types â†’ must use a stack.
* Python errors like `IndentationError` and `append[char]` are small but deadly â€” watch out.

Would you like me to also **add the multi-bracket stack solution** (`()[]{}`) at the bottom of this README as a bonus section, or keep this repo focused only on the original `()` problem?
